<hr>

- In this program, a neural net having two hidden layers is created. 
- Use of activation functions
  - sigmoid
  - tanh
  - Relu
  
- The neural net is tested on following three datasets:
  - **Car Evaluation Dataset**: 
    https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Car+Evaluation
  - **Iris Dataset**: 
    https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Iris
  - **Adult Census Income Dataset**: 
    https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Census+Income
- We have tried to tune the following parameters and presented our analysis in the report. Also detailed logs can be found <a href="https://github.com/patilankita79/NeuralNetworks/tree/master/Results">here.</a>
  - learning rate
  - number of iterations
  - number of nodes in the hidden layer
